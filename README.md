My favorite Movie Series is Transformers. Transformers is a series of American science fiction action films based on the Transformers franchise, which began in the 1980s. [note 1] Michael Bay directed the first five films: Transformers (2007), Revenge of the Fallen (2009), Dark of the Moon (2011), Age of Extinction (2014), and The Last Knight (2017), and has served as a producer for subsequent films. This movie establishes that Shakespeare knew about the existence of Transformers, as did humanityâ€™s greatest intellectuals and leaders dating back to King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, who were totally real. So was Merlin the Wizard. So were dragons. Everything is real. Nothing matters. This film will gross one trillion dollars.
